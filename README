USAGE:
bmlwriter srcpath destpath

For example to flash a zImage on SGS:
bmlwriter zImage /dev/block/bml7

RETURN VALUES:
Exit values are defined in bmlwritererror.h, read the ATTENTION section below!

SUCCESS: success

ERROR_INVALID_ARGC: invalid number of arguments to bmlwriter -> safe
ERROR_SRC_OPEN: srcfile can not be opened -> safe
ERROR_DST_OPEN: destpartition can not be opened -> safe
ERROR_UNLOCK_FAIL: bmlunlock failed -> safe

ERROR_FSTAT: copy failed on fstat -> safe
ERROR_READ: copy failed on read, but nothing written -> safe
FATAL_READ_PARTIAL_WRITE: copy failed on read, BUT with partial write -> UNSAFE -> RETRY FLASH!!!
ERROR_PARTIAL_READ: copy failed on partial read before file ends, but nothing written -> safe
FATAL_PARTIAL_READ_PARTIAL_WRITE: copy failed on partial read before file ends, BUT with partial write -> UNSAFE -> RETRY FLASH!!!
FATAL_WRITE copy failed on write -> UNSAFE -> RETRY FLASH!!!

ATTENTION:
ERROR_*	just indicate the program failed, but the destination partition remain untouched.
FATAL_*	indicate the program critically failed and the destination is PARTIAL written.
	That means the phone (mostly) will fail to boot at this point.
	FATAL errors are not often, but you should take care of them -> restart bmlwriter
