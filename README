bmlwriter - write bml partitions on Samsungs android smartphones

Usage:
bmlwriter srcpath destpath

For example to flash a zImage on SGS:
bmlwriter zImage /dev/block/bml7

ATTENTION:
Check the exit value, if it says below "UNSAFE -> RETRY FLASH!!!" on that particular value, you should do that!
That means the destination partition is only partial written and boot will fail!

Return values:
0: success
1: invalid number of arguments to bmlwriter -> safe
2: srcfile can not be opened -> safe
3: destpartition can not be opened -> safe
4: bmlunlock failed -> safe
5: copy failed on fstat -> safe
6: copy failed on read, but nothing written -> safe
7: copy failed on read, BUT with partial write -> UNSAFE -> RETRY FLASH!!!
8: copy failed on partial read before file ends, but nothing written -> safe
9: copy failed on partial read before file ends, BUT with partial write -> UNSAFE -> RETRY FLASH!!!
10 copy failed on write -> UNSAFE -> RETRY FLASH!!!
